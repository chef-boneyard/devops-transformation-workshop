## Objectives
The DevOps Acceleration Workshop is designed for organizations that have very little or no exposure to DevOps, its tooling and its organisational implications. 

Across 3 Days, attendees are taken through the core technical, organisational and methodological elements of DevOps and will identify and plan a project with which to get started on their road to experiencing DevOps for real in their organisation.

## Participants


## Approach
The workshop is split into 3 sections;

### *Introduction to DevOps*: 
One Day for executives, managers, developers and operations.
Topics covered:
1. Conway’s Law and how Silo’s beget supervision.
2. The Myth of Control and our inability to anticipate the implementation of an outcome.
3. What is DevOps and how is it related to Agile and Lean. And what is different this time?
*Output:* Identification of a real project that those present can work on over 6-8 weeks to get a real experience of DevOps at work.  

### *Agile Planning*: 
Two days for managers. Topics covered:
1. The Two Product Principle - and why developing products also means developing teams.
2. The IOTA framework: defining and iterating your product and your team.
3. Lean Teams: effectively running the team. 
4. Change and how to scale one DevOps project across your organisation.
*Output:* A plan, backlog, resource schedule and list of current blockers for discussion with executive sponsors.

### *DevOps Coaching*: 
Two days coaching in a hands-on lab environment for Architects, developers, operations people and hands-on engineers. Topics covered:
1. CHEF Delivery: What does a high velocity development pipeline look like?
2. CHEF DK: How does configuration management integrate with your development processes?
3. CHEF Compliance: What is the role of compliance in the DevOps pipeline?
4. CHEF Analytics: How do you detect and respond to issues in your production environment.

*Note: The Agile Planning and DevOps Coaching occur in parallel on days 2-3.* 

*Result: A well defined, executive sponsored project that will use DevOps principles and CHEF to deliver to production a small but non-trivial project in 6-8 weeks.* 

CHEF can provide ongoing support for this project, including CHEF fundamentals training, CHEF solutions consulting etc.   

## Success Criteria
The following items are *critical* to the event’s success:
1. Executive sponsor is present for all of day one and preferably a couple of his/her colleagues too. 
2. Representation as wide as possible: from Developers to Operations people. From project managers to product managers.
3. Checkpoint with Exec Sponsors on Day 2 and 3. 

## INTERNAL ONLY
### Sales Enablement
The DAW is an accelerator to the closing of a deal.

Not only will attendees get a deep overview and hands-on lab of CHEF but also define a project to work on. Therefore, the DAW is typically followed by a services proposal to work on the project as well as a node count.
