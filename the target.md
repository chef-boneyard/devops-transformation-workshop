# The Continuous Economy Target

There is so much talk of the methods we should adopt to become better, faster, more resilient…. But what we are transforming into? Now that we have chosen a new vehicle, where are we going and is it any better?

_“I cannot make you understand. I cannot make anyone understand what is happening inside me. I cannot even explain it to myself.”_ 
― Franz Kafka, The Metamorphosis

## Keeping the end in mind
As we consider how to transform our enterprises - in whatever form that might take - we often only have a vague idea of what the ultimate target for transformation might be. Of course, we spend a great deal of time elaborating what the ‘next’ step should be - say a single product team for a single product - but we are often so engrossed in the pragmatic next step that we ignore the visionary ultimate goal. After the synaptic sugar of stating the destination, we devolve quickly to checking the signposts. 

The ultimate goal is important. This is what keeps us going when it appears that nobody is listening, or those that are, are bent on opposition. It is also the stuff of the stories that we tell internally. However, it is here that we find the reason why so many of us shy away from that story; stuff it deep inside ourselves and only talk of its first few chapters. 

The easiest way for someone to cast doubt on what we propose is to ask, “How”. This has been wonderfully described, as an organisational narrative strategy by Peter Block in “[The Answer to How is Yes](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Answer-How-Yes-Acting-Matters-ebook/dp/B00D97FOPW/ref=la_B000APUHDA_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1445077558&sr=1-2).” The core insight is that asking the ‘How’ question before understanding purpose and value inevitably reduces the subsequent conversation to one of justification rather than explanation. It closes down conversation rather than opening it up. 

I am sure that you have tried, before today, to paint a picture of a compelling future - seeming rather remote from the current state it was either met with bewilderment or with, “Well, that’s just great, but HOW [much will it cost], [will you get it done], [will you scale it]. And the truth is, you had no idea. 

What we learn from our Agile experience is that all we can really bet on is the next one or two steps toward a contingent future state, our understanding of which evolves as we get closer to it through _action_. So the circumstances of people sharing this contingent, perhaps ephemeral, definition of the future are fraught with risk. We learn to have different kinds of conversations and create strategies to manage internal stakeholders’ perceptions and expectations along the way while we try to subtly guide the process in what we think is the right direction.

Sometimes these strategies are mundane, innocuous, and effective; perhaps a simple omission of the broader context - _“let’s not worry about scale until it becomes a problem, let’s just focus on making this team better..”_. I have used this many times before and it works.

But they can also be dangerous. Most dangerous is when these approaches crowd out our reflection on the target itself. To return to our opening argument, We become so obsessed with progress that the destination recedes from our consideration. 

These strategies seem inevitable. Understanding the underlying dynamics that make them so is important to understanding how to more effectively drive change and truly empower teams.  

## A Dismal Science
For a common and malignant example, consider the impact of wide scale automation in a large firm. To make a general point rather than talk specifically about software engineering, consider that this firm operates in the late 18th Century, the start of the industrial revolution. A fascinating [paper](http://www.cgeh.nl/sites/default/files/WorkingPapers/cgehwp57_depleijtweisdorf.pdf) by de Pleijt and Weisdorf from Utrecht University discusses the change in skills of workmen during the start of the industrial revolution. They tested the ‘deskilling hypothesis’ - the idea that the industrial revolution was built on lower skilled workmen and did not promote the growth of new skills. I make no claim on either side of this hypothesis but wish to use their findings as an example of a very common misconception change agents allow to develop in their organizations. 

A quote from the paper makes the point; _“while the sampled workforce was rather well educated before 1700, the growth in GDP per capita in England after 1700 was accompanied by a substantial episode of deskilling captured by a large rise in the share of workers deemed unskilled…”_ The skills mix that resulted from the use of new technology reduced the perceived value of a large part of the workforce, with the result that real wages increased very little over 150 years. 

Why is this example apposite? For two reasons:
1. Firstly, *we remain structured in our large enterprises much like we were at the peak of the industrial revolution*. A hundred years of scientific management and social group theory doesn’t seem to have shifted that mindset. 
2. Secondly, when driving large scale transformation we are often negligent in considering the effects upon those who remain ‘behind’. 

### _Deskilling is a major cause of innovation drag in enterprises and particularly in the case of technology driven change today_. 

As we see in the industrial revolution example, it took a hundred years or more for workers to re-skill and become able to reap the fruits of the new technology that had diminished the professions of their parents. *To all those enterprises that create a new separate division to do the ‘new stuff’ this should be a cautionary tale.* 

## Industrial Structure and Conway’s Law

Henry Ford had it right, apparently. Break tasks down into their smallest least creative parts enabling people to achieve speed (note: not expertise) and economy in performing those tasks repetitively. The metaphor of the production line and industrial task separation is well told in Charlie Chaplin’s ‘[Modern Times](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANXGJe6i3G8)’. 

The divisional structure we see in large enterprises today comes from two sources, the military demands of total war in the latter half of the 20th century and the industrial specialization required during that period. Both owe their world-views to an industrial model of task specialization. 

Art Kleiner in “[The Age of Heretics](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Age-Heretics-Reinvented-Management/dp/0470190701)” has noted that attempts to reinvent the corporation have been numerous since the end of the second world war, and usually driven by middle to senior level executives. He defines these people as ‘heretics’;  _”A heretic is someone who sees a truth that contradicts the conventional wisdom of the institution to which he or she belongs and remains loyal to both entities – the institution and the new truth.  Heretics are not apostates; they do not leave the “church.”  Instead they try to influence the larger institution to change for its own sake.”_

DuPont corporation is often cited as an early model of the modern divisional corporation. They found that at very large scale it was difficult to balance the expertise required in the business with the specific requirements of that business.

## The Operating Chasm
All too often the introduction of a new idea into a company is enabled by the creation of a separate team or unit. Even in small companies it is often easier to avoid changing existing established processes than it is to create an adjunct to them in the form of a new team.
