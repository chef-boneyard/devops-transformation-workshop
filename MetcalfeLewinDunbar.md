### Team's by the numbers

+ Dunbar's number - There is a cognitive limit to meaningful relationships
+ Metcalfe's law - Social utility of a network is measured by the potential number nodes _in contact_
+ Lewin's Equation - Behavior is a function of people in their environment
+ Parkinson's Law - the multiplication of subordinates
+ 2 Pizza teams = A number that approaches 5 and is never 8 (deadlock). While 20 is the upper bound for effective communication, anything over 9 can sextuple costs!

^ Asymmetry: If you have 3 team members, then you will have 4 communication channels, if you have 4 then you have 9. The formula is m-1^2. How do you measure the impact of asymmetrical communication, assuming you can identify it?

Alignment: Coherence and unity of vision is simply harder to maintain. This is where situated learning and CoP come to the rescue. Allow practitioners to establish normative behaviors, allow teams to execute on a clear product vision.

Consistency: Small teams pair effectively and are able to intervene effectively when qualitative norms are violated (style preferences, coding standards, library use, etc.)

Estimation: Why is this important? Cost and time estimates in software development are notoriously difficult. There is no standard way to measure 'cost per story point' or 'cost per use case'. Attempts to measure demonstrate that variation in estimates can be as high as 400%. A study in the late 90's showed that the 'cost per function point' of a team of size 7 was $566 and that of a team of size 14 was $2970

Lewin - it is not just your personal characteristics, but also your environment that drives your behavior. Your habits, your disposition is highly dependent upon context. In many cases, your environment will drive your behavior even more than your personality
