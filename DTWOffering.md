## Objectives
The DevOps Transformation Workshop is designed for organizations that have already had exposure to DevOps and its tooling and are battling with its organisational implications. 

Across 5 Days, attendees are taken through the core technical, organisational and methodological elements of DevOps and will self-identify and plan a number of real projects with which to practise. 

## Approach
The initial engagement is split into 4 sections;

### 1. *Introduction to DevOps*: 1 Day
Topics covered:
1. Conway’s Law and how Silo’s beget supervision.
2. The Myth of Control and our inability to anticipate the implementation of an outcome.
3. What is DevOps and how is it related to Agile and Lean. And what is different this time?
*Output:* Identification of a real project that those present can work on over 6-8 weeks to get a real experience of DevOps at work.  

### 2. *Agile Planning*: 2 Days
Topics covered:
1. The Two Product Principle - and why developing products also means developing teams.
2. The IOTA framework: defining and iterating your product and your team.
3. Lean Teams: effectively running the team. 
4. Change and how to scale one DevOps project across your organisation.
5. The CRUCIBLE: A high intensity activity designed to put everything you have learned to work. 
*Output:* A plan, backlog, resource schedule and list of current blockers for discussion with executive sponsors.

### 3. *DevOps Technical Coaching*: 2 Days
Two days more in-depth coaching in a lab environment, for Architects, developers, operations people and hands-on engineers. Topics covered:
1. What does a high velocity development pipeline look like?
2. How does configuration management integrate with your development processes?
3. What is the role of compliance in the DevOps pipeline?
4. How do you detect and respond to issues in your production environment.
*Output:* A clear understanding of how a high velocity development process works. 

*Overall Result: A well defined, executive sponsored project that will use DevOps principles and CHEF to deliver to production a small but non-trivial project in 6-8 weeks.* 

### 4. *DevOps Change Coaching*: 2 Days
Two days in parallel with the technical coaching. We form a coaching agreement with product owners, sponsoring executives and agree how we will engage over the next 6 months to assist them in thinking about and addressing their scale challenges - using the language and tools of the previous 3 days. 

This component is priced at Time and Materials of $10k per day for two experienced executive level coaches.  

## Success Criteria
The following items are *critical* to the event’s success:
1. Projects within well defined product sets are pre-identified together with CHEF. 
2. Product owners are present for all of day 1-3. 
3. Full stack representation for any of the projects present. i.e. Operations resources, infrastructure managers, Developers, Business Analysts, Architects etc.

## INTERNAL ONLY
### Sales Enablement
The DTW is a mechanism to assist an enterprise in scaling its devops practise and its consumption of CHEF. 

Unlike the DAW, the DTW does not split out the technical components. Everyone participates in the full 3 day programme. 

While the DAW makes explicit the demonstration of CHEF products in the coaching section, the DTW takes a less pushy approach given that attendees are already CHEF customers.
