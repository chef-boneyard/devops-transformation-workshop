### The Waiting is the Hardest Part

+ Stop starting, start finishing (input over outputs)
+ Flow efficiency
+ It's all about the WIP
+ Parkinsonâ€™s Law - work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion

^ Main ideas

Measure inputs, not outputs - It's all about WIP, Cycle time is the measure of time in the system from arrival to departure - Size does not matter :), neither does complexity

[arrival]-----> (in system) [departure]----->
