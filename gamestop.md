^ Style guide:
Use sketchnote yellow theme in Deckset
New Slides begin with  \n---\n
Main sections are single hash.
Sub sections are double hash.
talking points are listed on the slides as +
Additional concepts and detail are linked within the slides. see [Link Example](/linkexample.md)
We create an agenda separately from this file as it changes with every session (which is ok).
5 kinds of slides... Structure, Content, Activity, Concepts, Tools --> Each have a common layout and structure.
Talking points are now visible on the slides. We don't refer to the slides, they're just backgrounds and the text wont distract. Also - it allows us to easily send out a PDF of the slides with some actual content.
