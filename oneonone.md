# 1:1

---
## Why do we do 1:1s at Chef?

---
## What Value do You get From Yours?

Is it a priority for you?
Do you come prepared? Does your Manager?
Do you see a connection between your PDP and your 1:1?
Do you take notes? Does your manager?
Are they valuable to you?

## PDP & Notes

Review PDPs & Notes before the 1:1. This is the orientation point and the lens through which you can inspect development.

---
# How

Set a goal never to miss a single 1:1 and keep track of your actual performance against that goal.

---
#How

Have an agenda, encourage your team to have one too.

---
# It's Not About You
Not a status report

---
## It's Not About You

Appreciative inquiry
Listening
Identify Gaps in Knowledge and Experience

---
## Appreciative Inquiry

Ask questions from a perspective that this person is competent, trustworthy, capable, and awesome.

---
## Listen

Like 90% of the time (unless you are me)

---
## Gossip

Don't do it. Also, know that gossip is useful and maybe healthy. What you hear is what 'the office' is saying, so pay attention.

---
## Share Your Experience

This is maybe the only time it is actually valuable.

---
## Check Up

ask: 'How are you feeling?'

Check mood, stress level, engagement level... In relation to the 1:1 as much as to team and tasks

---
## Take Notes and Follow Up

Note taking, agenda setting, and follow make the 1:1  meeting valuable (and remove much of the randomness)

---
## Offer Help

Don't be afraid to get involved, but don't be the helicopter manager either.

---
## Seek Help

Don't be afraid to ask for things, but don't dump your 'do list' here either. Keep it in context.

## It's Their time

Don't be a hostage taker. Let folks go if there is not much to go over. Check if this becomes a pattern though.
